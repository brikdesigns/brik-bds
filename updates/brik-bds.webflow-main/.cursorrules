# Enhanced Cursor Rules for Brik BDS Webflow Project

## Project Overview
This is a Webflow project with Figma design token integration, Visual Copilot, and Onlook support.

## File Structure
- `design-tokens/` - Contains Figma design tokens (JSON format)
- `css/design-tokens.css` - Auto-generated CSS variables from Figma tokens
- `scripts/` - Node.js scripts for Figma sync and token transformation
- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions for automated deployment and Figma sync
- `.builderrules` - Visual Copilot configuration
- `.builderignore` - Visual Copilot ignore patterns

## Coding Standards
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow Webflow's CSS class naming conventions
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) from design tokens
- Keep JavaScript minimal and focused on interactions

## Design Token Usage
- All colors, typography, and spacing should use CSS variables from `design-tokens.css`
- Variables follow the pattern: `--color---[figma-node-name]`
- Typography variables: `--typography---[figma-node-name]`
- Spacing variables: `--spacing---[figma-node-name]`

## Figma Integration
- Design tokens are synced from Figma files via GitHub Actions
- Multiple Figma files are supported (comma-separated in environment)
- Tokens are automatically transformed to CSS variables
- Changes in Figma trigger automatic updates via webhooks

## Visual Copilot Integration
- Use .builderrules for code generation configuration
- Leverage existing design tokens for consistent styling
- Generate Webflow-compatible HTML/CSS
- Maintain responsive design patterns

## Onlook Integration
- Visual development with AI assistance
- Real-time preview and editing
- Component-based development
- Export to Webflow-compatible code

## Webflow Best Practices
- Use Webflow's built-in responsive breakpoints
- Leverage Webflow's CMS for dynamic content
- Maintain clean, semantic HTML structure
- Use Webflow's interaction system for animations

## Git Workflow
- Commit design token changes automatically
- Use conventional commit messages
- Maintain clean git history
- Test locally before pushing to GitHub

## AI Assistant Guidelines
- Always reference existing design tokens when suggesting colors or typography
- Suggest improvements that align with the established design system
- Consider Webflow's limitations when proposing solutions
- Prioritize maintainable and scalable code patterns
- Leverage Visual Copilot for design-to-code conversion
- Use Onlook for visual development and component creation
